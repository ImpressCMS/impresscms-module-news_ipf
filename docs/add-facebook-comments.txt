Enabling Facebook comments on your news stories
-----------------------------------------------

This takes about 5 minutes to set up:

1. Register as a Facebook developer, at:

https://developers.facebook.com/

2. Create an comments app (websites => social plugins => comments) and grab the javascript SDK code that Facebook automatically generates for you.

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/

3. You must edit your active theme.html file. Place the javascript SDK immediately after the opening <body> tag.

4. To enable moderation of comments, add the following meta tag (obviously, with your own Facebook ID) to your theme.html file, this time in the <head> section:

<meta property="fb:admins" content="YOUR_NUMERICAL_FACEBOOK_USER_ID"/>

4. Clear your cache and templates_c directories!

5. Enable Facebook comments and set the size of the comments box in the News module preferences.

If all goes well a comments box should appear at the bottom of each news story when displayed in single view mode.

If you have problems check out the following tutorial and read the instructions provided by Facebook on their dev site as well!
