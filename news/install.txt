How to install News
===================

News is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module. However, some functions (tags, categories, rights and Open Archives Initiative services) require the optional Sprockets module to be installed as well.

1. Copy the complete /news folder into the /modules directory of your website. 

2. Log in to your site as administrator. 

3. Go to System Admin > Modules, look for the News icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click on the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

4. You should also install the Sprockets module, as it makes News far more powerful. Sprockets is installed in the same way.
